    <h1>Lionel Messi</h1>
    <h1>
      Lionel Andrés Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes
      ˈmesi] (audio speaker iconlisten); born 24 June 1987), also known as Leo
      Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for
      Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team.
      Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one
      of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record seven Ballon
      d'Or awards,[note 2] a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was
      named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he
      had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a
      club-record 35 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey
      titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues. A prolific goalscorer and creative
      playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), a La
      Liga and European league season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and
      the UEFA Champions League (8), and most assists in La Liga (192), a La
      Liga season (21) and the Copa América (17). He also holds the record for
      most international goals by a South American male (80). Messi has scored
      over 750 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals
      by a player for a single club. Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi
      relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, for whom he made his
      competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an
      integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first
      uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first
      treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon
      d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four
      consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award
      four times and in a row.[10] During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga
      and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while
      establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two
      seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano
      Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form
      during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga
      and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was
      awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona
      in 2018, and in 2019 he won a record sixth Ballon d'Or. Out of contract,
      he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021. An Argentine
      international, Messi is both his country's highest appearance-maker and
      their all-time leading goalscorer. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA
      World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden
      Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer
      Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew
      comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his
      successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the
      youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup in 2006, and
      reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young
      player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led
      Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which
      he won the Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copa América, winning the
      Golden Ball in the 2015 edition. After announcing his international
      retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to
      qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the
      2019 Copa América, and won the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden
      Ball and Golden Boot award for the latter. This achievement would see him
      receive a record seventh Ballon d'Or in 2021. Messi has endorsed
      sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was
      the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009
      and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in
      2019. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in
      2011 and 2012. In February 2020, he was awarded the Laureus World
      Sportsman of the Year, thus becoming the first footballer and the first
      team sport athlete to win the award. Later that year, Messi became the
      second footballer (and second team-sport athlete) to surpass $1 billion in
      career earnings.
